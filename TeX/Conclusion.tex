\chapter{Conclusion}
\label{ch:conclusion}
Finally, at the end of this internship, I was able to develop a system of nodes which processes the real-time images and estimates camera poses and keyframe trajectory for a local ENU coordinate system and further can be extended to a global scale adapting it to ECEF coordinate system. For many reasons, my work may not be perfect but it has a lot of room for exploration and improvement. This report I would like to present gives an overall understanding on the tasks, challenges faced and development approaches that were carried out during the internship work. \\ 

This internship was an excellent and rewarding experience. During this course of work I have learnt the hard way by working on this platform. The internship gave me a great opportunity to explore new topics and skills and has made a identifiable growth in my scientific thinking and assertion skills. I believe my time spent in research and discovering new things was well worth it and contributed to the Fraunhofer Institute by finding acceptable solutions in a good way.
