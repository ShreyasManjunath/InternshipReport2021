I would like to thank my supervisor Mr. Boitumelo Ruf for providing this opportunity, his valuable guidance, comments and suggestions throughout the course of the project.for being patient with me answering all questions. The instant support he gave me every time i was struggling, made me work more responsibly and eager to bring results.\\
